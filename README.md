# Maps

## Brief description

#This project its divided into 4 class

#Main : Will create a Storage object by command line args. 

#Storage : Here we will store the arguments readed by command line. Then the array created will pass to Counter.

#Counter : In this class, the Storage object will be divided into a Map, this will be useful to count how much times a word is duplicated.

#Printer : This final class will have a method that prints the result of the map, with the word/number counted and the total of times it appeared in the data entry.
